For example, boxShadow has values like "10px 10px 20px 30px rgb(255,0,0)" which would utterly confuse other plugins. This method allows us to split that data apart and grab only the numeric data and attach it to uniquely-named properties of a generic proxy object ({}) so that we can feed that to virtually any plugin to have the numbers tweened. However, we must also keep track of which properties from the proxy go with which CSSPropTween values and instances. So we create a linked list of MiniPropTweens. Each one records a target (the original CSSPropTween), property (like "s" or "xn1" or "xn2") that we're tweening and the unique property name that was used for the proxy (like "boxShadow_xn1" and "boxShadow_xn2") and whether or not they need to be rounded. That way, in the _setPluginRatio() method we can simply copy the values over from the proxy to the CSSPropTween instance(s). Then, when the main CSSPlugin setRatio() method runs and applies the CSSPropTween values accordingly, they're updated nicely. So the external plugin tweens the numbers, _setPluginRatio() copies them over, and setRatio() acts normally, applying css-specific values to the element.
			 * This method returns an object that has the following properties:
			 *  - proxy: a generic object containing the starting values for all the properties that will be tweened by the external plugin.  This is what we feed to the external _onInitTween() as the target
			 *  - end: a generic object containing the ending values for all the properties that will be tweened by the external plugin. This is what we feed to the external plugin's _onInitTween() as the destination values
			 *  - firstMPT: the first MiniPropTween in the linked list
			 *  - pt: the first CSSPropTween in the linked list that was created when parsing. If shallow is true, this linked list will NOT attach to the one passed into the _parseToProxy() as the "pt" (4th) parameter.
			 * @param {!Object} t target object to be tweened
			 * @param {!(Object|string)} vars the object containing the information about the tweening values (typically the end/destination values) that should be parsed
			 * @param {!CSSPlugin} cssp The CSSPlugin instance
			 * @param {CSSPropTween=} pt the next CSSPropTween in the linked list
			 * @param {TweenPlugin=} plugin the external TweenPlugin instance that will be handling tweening the numeric values
			 * @param {boolean=} shallow if true, the resulting linked list from the parse will NOT be attached to the CSSPropTween that was passed in as the "pt" (4th) parameter.

			/**
			 * @constructor Each property that is tweened has at least one CSSPropTween associated with it. These instances store important information like the target, property, starting value, amount of change, etc. They can also optionally have a number of "extra" strings and numeric values named xs1, xn1, xs2, xn2, xs3, xn3, etc. where "s" indicates string and "n" indicates number. These can be pieced together in a complex-value tween (type:1) that has alternating types of data like a string, number, string, number, etc. For example, boxShadow could be "5px 5px 8px rgb(102, 102, 51)". In that value, there are 6 numbers that may need to tween and then pieced back together into a string again with spaces, suffixes, etc. xs0 is special in that it stores the suffix for standard (type:0) tweens, -OR- the first string (prefix) in a complex-value (type:1) CSSPropTween -OR- it can be the non-tweening value in a type:-1 CSSPropTween. We do this to conserve memory.
			 * CSSPropTweens have the following optional properties as well (not defined through the constructor):
			 *  - l: Length in terms of the number of extra properties that the CSSPropTween has (default: 0). For example, for a boxShadow we may need to tween 5 numbers in which case l would be 5; Keep in mind that the start/end values for the first number that's tweened are always stored in the s and c properties to conserve memory. All additional values thereafter are stored in xn1, xn2, etc.
			 *  - xfirst: The first instance of any sub-CSSPropTweens that are tweening properties of this instance. For example, we may split up a boxShadow tween so that there's a main CSSPropTween of type:1 that has various xs* and xn* values associated with the h-shadow, v-shadow, blur, color, etc. Then we spawn a CSSPropTween for each of those that has a higher priority and runs BEFORE the main CSSPropTween so that the values are all set by the time it needs to re-assemble them. The xfirst gives us an easy way to identify the first one in that chain which typically ends at the main one (because they're all prepende to the linked list)
			 *  - plugin: The TweenPlugin instance that will handle the tweening of any complex values. For example, sometimes we don't want to use normal subtweens (like xfirst refers to) to tween the values - we might want ThrowPropsPlugin or BezierPlugin some other plugin to do the actual tweening, so we create a plugin instance and store a reference here. We need this reference so that if we get a request to round values or disable a tween, we can pass along that request.
			 *  - data: Arbitrary data that needs to be stored with the CSSPropTween. Typically if we're going to have a plugin handle the tweening of a complex-value tween, we create a generic object that stores the END values that we're tweening to and the CSSPropTween's xs1, xs2, etc. have the starting values. We store that object as data. That way, we can simply pass that object to the plugin and use the CSSPropTween as the target.
			 *  - setRatio: Only used for type:2 tweens that require custom functionality. In this case, we call the CSSPropTween's setRatio() method and pass the ratio each time the tween updates. This isn't quite as efficient as doing things directly in the CSSPlugin's setRatio() method, but it's very convenient and flexible.
			 * @param {!Object} t Target object whose property will be tweened. Often a DOM element, but not always. It could be anything.
			 * @param {string} p Property to tween (name). For example, to tween element.width, p would be "width".
			 * @param {number} s Starting numeric value
			 * @param {number} c Change in numeric value over the course of the entire tween. For example, if element.width starts at 5 and should end at 100, c would be 95.
			 * @param {CSSPropTween=} next The next CSSPropTween in the linked list. If one is defined, we will define its _prev as the new instance, and the new instance's _next will be pointed at it.
			 * @param {number=} type The type of CSSPropTween where -1 = a non-tweening value, 0 = a standard simple tween, 1 = a complex value (like one that has multiple numbers in a comma- or space-delimited string like border:"1px solid red"), and 2 = one that uses a custom setRatio function that does all of the work of applying the values on each update.
			 * @param {string=} n Name of the property that should be used for overwriting purposes which is typically the same as p but not always. For example, we may need to create a subtween for the 2nd part of a "clip:rect(...)" tween in which case "p" might be xs1 but "n" is still "clip"
			 * @param {boolean=} r If true, the value(s) should be rounded
			 * @param {number=} pr Priority in the linked list order. Higher priority CSSPropTweens will be updated before lower priority ones. The default priority is 0.
			 * @param {string=} b Beginning value. We store this to ensure that it is EXACTLY what it was when the tween began without any risk of interpretation issues.
			 * @param {string=} e Ending value. We store this to ensure that it is EXACTLY what the user defined at the end of the tween without any risk of interpretation issues.

			 * It will walk through the beginning and ending values (which should be in the same format with the same number and type of values) and figure out which parts are numbers, what strings separate the numeric/tweenable values, and then create the CSSPropTweens accordingly. If a plugin is defined, no child CSSPropTweens will be created. Instead, the ending values will be stored in the "data" property of the returned CSSPropTween like: {s:-5, xn1:-10, xn2:-20, xn3:255, xn4:0, xn5:0} so that it can be fed to any other plugin and it'll be plain numeric tweens but the recomposition of the complex value will be handled inside CSSPlugin's setRatio().
			 * If a setRatio is defined, the type of the CSSPropTween will be set to 2 and recomposition of the values will be the responsibility of that method.
			 *
			 * @param {!Object} t Target whose property will be tweened
			 * @param {!string} p Property that will be tweened (its name, like "left" or "backgroundColor" or "boxShadow")
			 * @param {string} b Beginning value
			 * @param {string} e Ending value
			 * @param {boolean} clrs If true, the value could contain a color value like "rgb(255,0,0)" or "#F00" or "red". The default is false, so no colors will be recognized (a performance optimization)
			 * @param {(string|number|Object)} dflt The default beginning value that should be used if no valid beginning value is defined or if the number of values inside the complex beginning and ending values don't match
			 * @param {?CSSPropTween} pt CSSPropTween instance that is the current head of the linked list (we'll prepend to this).
			 * @param {number=} pr Priority in the linked list order. Higher priority properties will be updated before lower priority ones. The default priority is 0.

However, the end values WILL be populated in the "data" property, like {s:100, xn1:50, xn2:300}
			 * @param {function(number)=} setRatio If values should be set in a custom function instead of being pieced together in a type:1 (complex-value) CSSPropTween, define that custom function here.

Every SpecialProp is associated with a particular property name like "boxShadow" or "throwProps" or "bezier" and it will intercept those values in the vars object that's passed to the CSSPlugin and handle them accordingly.
		 * @param {!string} p Property name (like "boxShadow" or "throwProps")
		 * @param {Object=} options An object containing any of the following configuration options:

		 *                      - parser: A function that should be called when the associated property name is found in the vars.

		 *                      - multi: if true, the formatter should accommodate a comma-delimited list of values, like boxShadow could have multiple boxShadows listed out.
		 *                      - collapsible: if true, the formatter should treat the value like it's a top/right/bottom/left value that could be collapsed, like "5px" would apply to all, "5px, 10px" would use 5px for top/bottom and 10px for right/left, etc.
		 *                      - keyword: a special keyword that can [optionally] be found inside the value (like "inset" for boxShadow). This allows us to validate beginning/ending values to make sure they match (if the keyword is found in one, it'll be added to the other for consistency by default).

		 * Registers a special property that should be intercepted from any "css" objects defined in tweens. This allows you to handle them however you want without CSSPlugin doing it for you. The 2nd parameter should be a function that accepts 3 parameters:
		 *  1) Target object whose property should be tweened (typically a DOM element)
		 *  2) The end/destination value (could be a string, number, object, or whatever you want)
		 *  3) The tween instance (you probably don't need to worry about this, but it can be useful for looking up information like the duration)
		 *
		 * Then, your function should return a function which will be called each time the tween gets rendered, passing a numeric "ratio" parameter to your function that indicates the change factor (usually between 0 and 1). For example:
		 *
		 * CSSPlugin.registerSpecialProp("myCustomProp", function(target, value, tween) {
		 *      var start = target.style.width;
		 *      return function(ratio) {
		 *              target.style.width = (start + value * ratio) + "px";
		 *              console.log("set width to " + target.style.width);
		 *          }
		 * }, 0);
		 *
		 * Then, when I do this tween, it will trigger my special property:
		 *
		 * TweenLite.to(element, 1, {css:{myCustomProp:100}});
		 *
		 * In the example, of course, we're just changing the width, but you can do anything you want.
		 *
		 * @param {!string} name Property name (or comma-delimited list of property names) that should be intercepted and handled by your function. For example, if I define "myCustomProp", then it would handle that portion of the following tween: TweenLite.to(element, 1, {css:{myCustomProp:100}})
		 * @param {!function(Object, Object, Object, string):function(number)} onInitTween The function that will be called when a tween of this special property is performed. The function will receive 4 parameters: 1) Target object that should be tweened, 2) Value that was passed to the tween, 3) The tween instance itself (rarely used), and 4) The property name that's being tweened. Your function should return a function that should be called on every update of the tween. That function will receive a single parameter that is a "change factor" value (typically between 0 and 1) indicating the amount of change as a ratio. You can use this to determine how to set the values appropriately in your function.
		 * @param {number=} priority Priority that helps the engine determine the order in which to set the properties (default: 0). Higher priority properties will be updated before lower priority ones.

		 *  - If I create a tween of elementA, that tween instance may suddenly change its target to include 50 other elements (unintuitive if I specifically defined the target I wanted)
		 *  - We can't just create new independent tweens because otherwise, what happens if the original/parent tween is reversed or pause or dropped into a TimelineLite for tight control? You'd expect that tween's behavior to affect all the others.
		 *  - Analyzing every style property of every child before and after the tween is an expensive operation when there are many children, so this behavior shouldn't be imposed on all className tweens by default, especially since it's probably rare that this extra functionality is needed.

			 * @constructor
			 * Defines a GreenSock class, optionally with an array of dependencies that must be instantiated first and passed into the definition.
			 * This allows users to load GreenSock JS files in any order even if they have interdependencies (like CSSPlugin extends TweenPlugin which is
			 * inside TweenLite.js, but if CSSPlugin is loaded first, it should wait to run its code until TweenLite.js loads and instantiates TweenPlugin
			 * and then pass TweenPlugin to CSSPlugin's definition). This is all done automatically and internally.
			 *
			 * Every definition will be added to a "com.greensock" global object (typically window, but if a window.GreenSockGlobals object is found,
			 * it will go there as of v1.7). For example, TweenLite will be found at window.com.greensock.TweenLite and since it's a global class that should be available anywhere,
			 * it is ALSO referenced at window.TweenLite. However some classes aren't considered global, like the base com.greensock.core.Animation class, so
			 * those will only be at the package like window.com.greensock.core.Animation. Again, if you define a GreenSockGlobals object on the window, everything
			 * gets tucked neatly inside there instead of on the window directly. This allows you to do advanced things like load multiple versions of GreenSock
			 * files and put them into distinct objects (imagine a banner ad uses a newer version but the main site uses an older one). In that case, you could
			 * sandbox the banner one like:
			 *
			 * <script>
			 *     var gs = window.GreenSockGlobals = {}; //the newer version we're about to load could now be referenced in a "gs" object, like gs.TweenLite.to(...). Use whatever alias you want as long as it's unique, "gs" or "banner" or whatever.
			 * </script>
			 * <script src="js/greensock/v1.7/TweenMax.js"></script>
			 * <script>
			 *     window.GreenSockGlobals = null; //reset it back to null so that the next load of TweenMax affects the window and we can reference things directly like TweenLite.to(...)
			 * </script>
			 * <script src="js/greensock/v1.6/TweenMax.js"></script>
			 * <script>
			 *     gs.TweenLite.to(...); //would use v1.7
			 *     TweenLite.to(...); //would use v1.6
			 * </script>
			 *
			 * @param {!string} ns The namespace of the class definition, leaving off "com.greensock." as that's assumed. For example, "TweenLite" or "plugins.CSSPlugin" or "easing.Back".
			 * @param {!Array.<string>} dependencies An array of dependencies (described as their namespaces minus "com.greensock." prefix). For example ["TweenLite","plugins.TweenPlugin","core.Animation"]
			 * @param {!function():Object} func The function that should be called and passed the resolved dependencies which will return the actual class for this definition.
			 * @param {boolean=} global If true, the class will be added to the global scope (typically window unless you define a window.GreenSockGlobals object)

      // `String` (major.minor.patch), since 1.1

      version: '1.3.0',

      // Options
      // -------
      //
      // When calling `.reel()` method you have plenty of options (far too many) available.
      // You collect them into one hash and supply them with your call.
      //
      // _**Example:** Initiate a non-looping Reel with 12 frames:_
      //
      //     .reel({
      //       frames: 12,
      //       looping: false
      //     })
      //
      //
      // All options are optional and if omitted, default value is used instead.
      // Defaults are being housed as members of `$.reel.def` hash.
      // If you customize any default value therein, all subsequent `.reel()` calls
      // will use the new value as default.
      //
      // _**Example:** Change default initial frame to 5th:_
      //
      //     $.reel.def.frame = 5
      //
      // ---

      // ### `$.reel.def` ######
      // `Object`, since 1.1
      //
      def: {
        //
        // ### Basic Definition ######
        //
        // Reel is just fine with you not setting any options, however if you don't have
        // 36 frames or beginning at frame 1, you will want to set total number
        // of `frames` and pick a different starting `frame`.
        //
        // ---

        // #### `frame` Option ####
        // `Number` (frames), since 1.0
        //
        frame:                  1,

        // #### `frames` Option ####
        // `Number` (frames), since 1.0
        //
        frames:                36,

        // ~~~
        //
        // Another common characteristics of any Reel is whether it `loops` and covers
        // entire 360° or not.
        //
        // ---

        // #### `loops` Option ####
        // `Boolean`, since 1.0
        //
        loops:               true,


        // ### Interaction ######
        //
        // Using boolean switches many user interaction aspects can be turned on and off.
        // You can disable the mouse wheel control with `wheelable`, the drag & throw
        // action with `throwable`, disallow the dragging completely with `draggable`,
        // on touch devices you can disable the browser's decision to scroll the page
        // instead of Reel script and you can of course disable the stepping of Reel by
        // clicking on either half of the image with `steppable`.
        //
        // You can even enable `clickfree` operation,
        // which will cause Reel to bind to mouse enter/leave events instead of mouse down/up,
        // thus allowing a click-free dragging.
        //
        // ---

        // #### `clickfree` Option ####
        // `Boolean`, since 1.1
        //
        clickfree:          false,

        // #### `draggable` Option ####
        // `Boolean`, since 1.1
        //
        draggable:           true,

        // #### `scrollable` Option ####
        // `Boolean`, since 1.2
        //
        scrollable:          true,

        // #### `steppable` Option ####
        // `Boolean`, since 1.2
        //
        steppable:           true,

        // #### `throwable` Option ####
        // `Boolean`, since 1.1; or `Number`, since 1.2.1
        //
        throwable:           true,

        // #### `wheelable` Option ####
        // `Boolean`, since 1.1
        //
        wheelable:           true,


        // ### [NEW] Gyroscope Support ######
        //
        // When enabled allows gyro-enabled devices (iPad2 for example) to control rotational
        // position using the device's attitude in space. In this more, Reel directly maps the
        // 360° range of your gyro's primary (alpha) axis directly to the value of `fraction`.
        //
        // #### `orientable` Option ####
        // [NEW] `Boolean`, since 1.3
        //
        orientable:         false,


        // ### Order of Images ######
        //
        // Reel presumes counter-clockwise order of the pictures taken. If the nearer facing
        // side doesn't follow your cursor/finger, you did clockwise. Use the `cw` option to
        // correct this.
        //
        // ---

        // #### `cw` Option ####
        // `Boolean`, since 1.1
        //
        cw:                 false,


        // ### Sensitivity ######
        //
        // In Reel sensitivity is set through the `revolution` parameter, which represents horizontal
        // dragging distance one must cover to perform one full revolution. By default this value
        // is calculated based on the setup you have - it is either twice the width of the image
        // or half the width of stitched panorama. You may also set your own.
        //
        // Optionally `revolution` can be set as an Object with `x` member for horizontal revolution
        // and/or `y` member for vertical revolution in multi-row movies.
        //
        // ---

        // #### `revolution` Option ####
        // `Number` (pixels) or `Object`, since 1.1, `Object` support since 1.2
        //
        revolution:     undefined,


        // ### Rectilinear Panorama ######
        //
        // The easiest of all is the stitched panorama mode. For this mode, instead of the sprite,
        // a single seamlessly stitched stretched image is used and the view scrolls the image.
        // This mode is triggered by setting a pixel width of the `stitched` image.
        //
        // ---

        // #### `stitched` Option ####
        // `Number` (pixels), since 1.0
        //
        stitched:               0,


        // ### Directional Mode ######
        //
        // As you may have noticed on Reel's homepage or in [`example/object-movie-directional-sprite`][1]
        // when you drag the arrow will point to either direction. In such `directional` mode, the sprite
        // is actually 2 in 1 - one file contains two sprites one tightly following the other, one
        // for visually going one way (`A`) and one for the other (`B`).
        //
        //     A01 A02 A03 A04 A05 A06
        //     A07 A08 A09 A10 A11 A12
        //     A13 A14 A15 B01 B02 B03
        //     B04 B05 B06 B07 B08 B09
        //     B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15
        //
        // Switching between `A` and `B` frames is based on direction of the drag. Directional mode isn't
        // limited to sprites only, sequences also apply. The figure below shows the very same setup like
        // the above figure, only translated into actual frames of the sequence.
        //
        //     001 002 003 004 005 006
        //     007 008 009 010 011 012
        //     013 014 015 016 017 018
        //     019 020 021 022 023 024
        //     025 026 027 028 029 030
        //
        // Frame `016` represents the `B01` so it actually is first frame of the other direction.
        //
        // [1]:../example/object-movie-directional-sprite/
        //
        // ---

        // #### `directional` Option ####
        // `Boolean`, since 1.1
        //
        directional:        false,


        // ### Multi-Row Mode ######
        //
        // As [`example/object-movie-multirow-sequence`][1] very nicely demonstrates, in multi-row arrangement
        // you can perform two-axis manipulation allowing you to add one or more vertical angles. Think of it as
        // a layered cake, each new elevation of the camera during shooting creates one layer of the cake -
        // - a _row_. One plain horizontal object movie full spin is one row:
        //
        //     A01 A02 A03 A04 A05 A06
        //     A07 A08 A09 A10 A11 A12
        //     A13 A14 A15
        //
        // Second row tightly follows after the first one:
        //
        //     A01 A02 A03 A04 A05 A06
        //     A07 A08 A09 A10 A11 A12
        //     A13 A14 A15 B01 B02 B03
        //     B04 B05 B06 B07 B08 B09
        //     B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15
        //     C01...
        //
        // This way you stack up any number of __`rows`__ you wish and set the initial `row` to start with.
        // Again, not limited to sprites, sequences also apply.
        //
        // [1]:../example/object-movie-multirow-sequence/
        //
        // ---

        // #### `row` Option ####
        // `Number` (rows), since 1.1
        //
        row:                    1,

        // #### `rows` Option ####
        // `Number` (rows), since 1.1
        //
        rows:                   0,


        // ### [NEW] Multi-Row Locks ######
        //
        // Optionally you can apply a lock on either of the two axes with `rowlock` and/or `framelock`.
        // That will disable direct mouse interaction and will leave using of `.reel()` the only way
        // of changing position on the locked axis.
        //
        // ---

        // #### `rowlock` Option ####
        // [NEW] `Boolean`, since 1.3
        //
        rowlock:            false,

        // #### `framelock` Option ####
        // [NEW] `Boolean`, since 1.3
        //
        framelock:          false,


        // ### Dual-Orbit Mode ######
        //
        // Special form of multi-axis movie is the dual-axis mode. In this mode the object offers two plain
        // spins - horizontal and vertical orbits combined together crossing each other at the `frame`
        // forming sort of a cross if envisioned. [`example/object-movie-dual-orbit-sequence`][1] demonstrates
        // this setup. When the phone in the example is facing you (marked in the example with green square
        // in the top right), you are at the center. That is within the distance (in frames) defined
        // by the `orbital` option. Translation from horizontal to vertical orbit can be achieved on this sweet-spot.
        // By default horizontal orbit is chosen first, unless `vertical` option is used against.
        //
        // In case the image doesn't follow the vertical drag, you may have your vertical orbit `inversed`.
        //
        // Technically it is just a two-layer movie:
        //
        //     A01 A02 A03 A04 A05 A06
        //     A07 A08 A09 A10 A11 A12
        //     A13 A14 A15 B01 B02 B03
        //     B04 B05 B06 B07 B08 B09
        //     B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15
        //
        // [1]:../example/object-movie-dual-orbit-sequence/
        //
        // ---

        // #### `orbital` Option ####
        // `Number` (frames), since 1.1
        //
        orbital:                0,

        // #### `vertical` Option ####
        // `Boolean`, since 1.1
        //
        vertical:           false,

        // #### `inversed` Option ####
        // `Boolean`, since 1.1
        //
        inversed:           false,


        // ### Sprite Layout ######
        //
        // For both object movies and panoramas Reel presumes you use a combined _Sprite_ to hold all your
        // frames in a single file. This powerful technique of using a sheet of several individual images
        // has many advantages in terms of compactness, loading, caching, etc. However, know your enemy,
        // be also aware of the limitations, which stem from memory limits of mobile
        // (learn more in [FAQ](https://github.com/pisi/Reel/wiki/FAQ)).
        //
        // Inside the sprite, individual frames are laid down one by one, to the right of the previous one
        // in a straight _Line_:
        //
        //     01 02 03 04 05 06

        //   revolution leaving the gaps in-between as small as possible. This results in a gradually
        //   increasing fidelity of the image rather than having one large shrinking gap. This is the default

        //
        // Often also called inertial motion is a result of measuring a velocity of dragging. This velocity
        // builds up momentum, so when a drag is released, the image still retains the momentum and continues
        // to spin on itself. Naturally the momentum soon wears off as `brake` is being applied.
        //
        // One can utilize this momentum for a different kind of an opening animation. By setting initial
        // `velocity`, the instance gets artificial momentum and spins to slow down to stop.
        //
        // ---

        // #### `brake` Option ####

        // ### Ticker ######
        //
        // For purposes of animation, Reel starts and maintains a timer device which emits ticks timing all
        // animations. There is only one ticker running in the document and all instances subscribe to this
        // one ticker. Ticker is equipped with a mechanism, which compensates for the  measured costs
        // of running Reels to ensure the ticker ticks on time. The `tempo` (in Hz) of the ticker can be
        // specified.
        //
        // Please note, that ticker is synchronized with a _leader_, the oldest living instance on page,
        // and adjusts to his tempo.

        // ~~~
        //
        // Since many mobile devices are sometimes considerably underpowered in comparison with desktops,
        // they often can keep up with the 36 Hz rhythm. In Reel these are called __lazy devices__
        // and everything mobile qualifies as lazy for the sake of the battery and interaction fluency.
        // The ticker is under-clocked for them by a `laziness` factor, which is used to divide the `tempo`.
        // Default `laziness` of `6` will effectively use 6 Hz instead (6 = 36 / 6) on lazy devices.

        // You can customize Reel on both functional and visual front. The most visible thing you can
        // customize is probably the `cursor`, size of the `preloader`, perhaps add visual `indicator`(s)
        // of Reel's position within the range. You can also set custom `hint` for the tooltip, which appears
        // when you mouse over the image area. Last but not least you can also add custom class name `klass`

      // -----------------
      // [NEW] Quick Start
      // -----------------
      //
      // For basic Reel initialization, you don't even need to write any Javascript!
      // All it takes is to add __class name__ `"reel"` to your `<img>` HTML tag,
      // assign an unique __`id` attribute__ and decorate the tag with configuration __data attributes__.
      // Result of which will be interactive Reel projection.
      //
      //     <img src="some/image.jpg" width="300" height="200"
      //       id="my_image"
      //       class="reel"
      //       data-images="some/images/01.jpg, some/images/02.jpg"
      //       data-speed="0.5">
      //
      // All otherwise Javascript [options](#Options) are made available as HTML `data-*` attributes.
      //
      // Only the `annotations` option doesn't work this way. To quickly create annotations,
      // simply have any HTML node (`<div>` prefferably) anywhere in the DOM,
      // assign it __class name__ `"reel-annotation"`, an unique __`id` attribute__
      // and add configuration __data attributes__.
      //
      //     <div id="my_annotation"
      //       class="reel-annotation"
      //       data-for="my_image"
      //       data-x="120"
      //       data-y="60">
      //       Whatever HTML I'd like to have in the annotation
      //     </div>
      //
      // Most important is the `data-for` attribute, which references target Reel instance by `id`.
      //
      // ---

      //
      // Responsible for discovery and subsequent conversion of data-configured Reel images is
      // `$.reel.scan()` method, which is being called automagically when the DOM becomes ready.
      // Under normal circumstances you don't need to scan by yourself.
      //
      // It however comes in handy to re-scan when you happen to inject a data-configured Reel `<img>`
      // into already ready DOM.
